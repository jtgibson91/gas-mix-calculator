# gas-mix-calculator
A CLI script for calculating gas mix values. Takes the following input from the user:
  - Gas cylinder size (250 mol, 350 mol)
  - Gas components (e.g. H2, CO2, N2, etc.) and their percentage by volume 

  - The script then returns the weight (kilograms) of each component required to make the specified mix
